# MCP Ableton Server

## 📌 Overview
The **Ableton Live MCP Server** is a server implementing the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) to facilitate communication between LLMs and **Ableton Live**. It uses **OSC (Open Sound Control)** to send and receive messages to/from Ableton Live.
It is based on [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC) implementation and exhaustively maps available OSC adresses to [**tools**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) accessible to MCP clients.

This project consists of two main components:
- `mcp_ableton_server.py`: The MCP server handling the communication between clients and the OSC daemon.
- `osc_daemon.py`: The OSC daemon responsible for relaying commands to Ableton Live and processing responses.

## ✨ Features
- Provides an MCP-compatible API for controlling Ableton Live from MCP clients.
- Uses **python-osc** for sending and receiving OSC messages.
- Based on the OSC implementation from [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC).
- Implements request-response handling for Ableton Live commands.

## ⚡ Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `python-osc` (for OSC communication)
- `fastmcp` (for MCP support)

### Installation Steps
1. Install `uv`
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp_ableton_server.git
   cd mcp_ableton_server
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv install python-osc fastmcp
   ```
4. Install the MCP Server
   This assumes that you're using [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
   ```bash
   mcp install mcp_ableton_server.py
   ```
## 🚀 Usage

### Running the OSC Daemon
The OSC daemon will handle OSC communication between the MCP server and Ableton Live:
```bash
python osc_daemon.py
```
This will:
- Listen for MCP client connections on port **65432**.
- Forward messages to Ableton Live via OSC on port **11000**.
- Receive OSC responses from Ableton on port **11001**.

### Example Usage
In Claude desktop, ask Claude:
*Prepare a set to record a rock band*
*Set the input routing channel of all tracks that have "voice" in their name to Ext. In 2*

## ⚙️ Configuration
By default, the server and daemon run on **localhost (127.0.0.1)** with the following ports:
- **MCP Server Socket:** 65432
- **Ableton Live OSC Port (Send):** 11000
- **Ableton Live OSC Port (Receive):** 11001

To modify these, edit the `AbletonOSCDaemon` class in `osc_daemon.py`:
```python
self.socket_host = '127.0.0.1'
self.socket_port = 65432
self.ableton_host = '127.0.0.1'
self.ableton_port = 11000
self.receive_port = 11001
```

### Claude Desktop Configurations
- macOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`


```json
