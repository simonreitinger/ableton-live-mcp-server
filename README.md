# Ableton Live MCP Server

## Changes

This fork has been modified to work fully locally with Ollama and pydantic_ai.

In addition to the setup mentioned below you have to run

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
ollama serve
```

to host the LLM and


```python
uv run main.py
```

to launch the chatbot.

## üìå Overview

The **Ableton Live MCP Server** is a server implementing the
[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) to facilitate
communication between LLMs and **Ableton Live**. It uses **OSC (Open Sound
Control)** to send and receive messages to/from Ableton Live. It is based on
[AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC) implementation and
exhaustively maps available OSC adresses to
[**tools**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) accessible to
MCP clients.

[![Control Ableton Live with LLMs](https://img.youtube.com/vi/12MzsQ3V7cs/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12MzsQ3V7cs)

This project consists of two main components:

- `mcp_ableton_server.py`: The MCP server handling the communication between
  clients and the OSC daemon.
- `osc_daemon.py`: The OSC daemon responsible for relaying commands to Ableton
  Live and processing responses.

## ‚ú® Features

- Provides an MCP-compatible API for controlling Ableton Live from MCP clients.
- Uses **python-osc** for sending and receiving OSC messages.
- Based on the OSC implementation from
  [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC).
- Implements request-response handling for Ableton Live commands.

## ‚ö° Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `python-osc` (for OSC communication)
- `fastmcp` (for MCP support)
- `uv` (recommended Python package installer)
- [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC) as a control surface

### Installation Steps

1. Install `uv` (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation):

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp_ableton_server.git
   cd mcp_ableton_server
   ```

3. Install the project and its dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. Install AbletonOSC Follow the instructions at
   [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC)

## üöÄ Usage

### Running the OSC Daemon

The OSC daemon will handle OSC communication between the MCP server and Ableton
Live:

```bash
uv run osc_daemon.py
```

This will:

- Listen for MCP client connections on port **65432**.
- Forward messages to Ableton Live via OSC on port **11000**.
- Receive OSC responses from Ableton on port **11001**.

### Example Usage

In Claude desktop, ask Claude:

- _Prepare a set to record a rock band_
- _Set the input routing channel of all tracks that have "voice" in their name
  to Ext. In 2_

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

By default, the server and daemon run on **localhost (127.0.0.1)** with the
following ports:

- **MCP Server Socket:** 65432
- **Ableton Live OSC Port (Send):** 11000
- **Ableton Live OSC Port (Receive):** 11001

To modify these, edit the `AbletonOSCDaemon` class in `osc_daemon.py`:

```python
self.socket_host = '127.0.0.1'
self.socket_port = 65432
self.ableton_host = '127.0.0.1'
self.ableton_port = 11000
self.receive_port = 11001
```

### Claude Desktop Configuration

To use this server with Claude Desktop, you need to configure it in your Claude
Desktop settings. The configuration file location varies by operating system:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following configuration to your `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Ableton Live Controller": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/project/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/project/mcp_ableton_server.py"]
    }
  }
```

This configuration ensures that:

- The server runs with all dependencies properly managed
- The project remains portable and reproducible
